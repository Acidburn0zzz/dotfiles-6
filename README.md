# ravasthi's dotfiles

**Please note that the TextMate features of these dotfiles are for TextMate 2, currently in beta.**

## Installation

Choose a place to store the dotfiles, like `~/Library/dotfiles`.

```
git clone git://github.com/ravasthi/dotfiles ~/Library/dotfiles
cd ~/Library/dotfiles
git submodule init
git submodule update
rake install
```

### Shell support

This dotfiles repo currently supports both bash and oh my zsh, with bash support being deprecated sometime in the near future.

Some features of the `bashrc` may work only with bash version 4.2 and greater with bash-completion, which is not installed by default on the Mac. Consider using these steps to get it:

* `brew install bash bash-completion`
* Add `/usr/local/bin/bash` to `/etc/shells`
* Change your shell to `/usr/local/bin/bash` by running `chsh`

For oh my zsh setup, do the following:

* Install [oh my zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
* Install [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
* Install the [github gem](https://github.com/defunkt/github-gem)â€”this is preferred over the `hub` brew.

## Notable features

* These dotfiles assume a Mac setup that uses `rvm` and Homebrew, with the `bash-completion` and `git` brews installed. See *Shell support* above for details.

* An `r` command serves as a shortcut for running `bundle exec rake` or `bundle exec rails`. It's pretty smart, so `r s` will expand to `bundle exec rails server`, and `r db` will expand to `bundle exec rake db:console`. No more fat-finger mistakes of `rails` vs `rake`!

* A supercharged prompt for both bash and zsh with ruby and git information, with help from the [zsh-git-prompt](https://github.com/olivierverdier/zsh-git-prompt/blob/master/zshrc.sh) and [bash-git-prompt](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt) plugins. To tweak, change the configuration in `git-prompt-colors.sh` for bash and `oh-my-zsh-custom/themes/richa.zsh-theme` for zsh.

* An `edit` shim will launch `mate` (TextMate) if you are on your local Mac, and fall back to `vi` if you are logged in via ssh. This shim is used as the git editor and svn editor.

* The `mp` script (short for "(Text)Mate project") opens a directory in TextMate. But unlike the basic `mate` command, if the directory does not already have a `.tm_properties`, a basic one will be created.

* This repo also comes with tmux and vim configurations, for you terminal purists. To use:

    * `brew install tmux`
    * `brew install reattach-to-user-namespace`

* Multi-monitor window management setup files are available for [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org):
    * Download and install the [latest release](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/releases/latest)
    * Tweak the configuration in `hammerspoon/init.lua` as you like
